YoutubeDownloaderBot

A Telegram frontend for YouTube. Development is about to start in the coming days.

My intentions with this project are to create an easy-to-use alternative for Telegram users who want to access YouTube without the clutter of recommendations, shorts, advertisements, comments, likes/dislikes, and views. I want to focus on what matters most to the user: finding videos that are appealing and relevant to them.

Features I want to implement:

* Downloading videos in high quality up to 2GB per file.
* Downloading videos as audio files.
* A search system that matches or exceeds YouTube's search functionality.
* Integration of the SponsorBlock API to remove sponsored segments from videos.
* A customizable subscription system that tracks your favorite channels and notifies you about new videos.

Please note that I will not host this bot for everyone, but I will keep the source code open so you can host it yourself. If you want to host it for others, I will add support for multiple users.
